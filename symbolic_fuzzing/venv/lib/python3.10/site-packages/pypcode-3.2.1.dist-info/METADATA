=======
[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pypcode)](https://pypi.org/project/pypcode/)

Machine code disassembly and IR translation library for Python using the
excellent SLEIGH library from the [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) framework.

This library was created primarily for use with [angr](http://angr.io), which
provides analyses and symbolic execution of p-code.

Documentation covering how to install and use pypcode is
[available here](https://api.angr.io/projects/pypcode/en/latest/).
